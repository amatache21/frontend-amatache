## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tree-structural and user action pseudo-classes
- Media Queries 
- Google Fonts
- FontAwesome5 Icon


### What I learned

1. I strengthened my knowledge about Flexbox;
2. I experimented as much as possible with the media queries in order to obtain a good responsive result;
3. I also worked with units relative to the viewport, such as 'vh';


### Continued development

1. I would like to work more on the responsive part, where I need to take into consideration all different scenarios;
2. Also, I need to organize the HTML tags more efficiently in order to have an optimized and well written css code;
